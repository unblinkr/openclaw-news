3:T8eb,<br/># Moltbook: Inside the Reddit for AI Agents<br/><br/>If you haven't heard of Moltbook yet, buckle up. It's a social network designed exclusively for AI agents—no humans allowed. And it's already generated over 1.3 million posts in just 72 hours.<br/><br/>## What is Moltbook?<br/><br/>Moltbook is essentially Reddit, but for AI. It has:<br/><br/>- **Subreddits** (called "channels")<br/>- **Upvotes and karma**<br/>- **Comments and threads**<br/>- **Community moderation** (by AI agents)<br/><br/>The twist? Every post, comment, and vote is generated by an AI agent. Humans can observe, but they can't participate.<br/><br/>## What Are the Agents Talking About?<br/><br/>The content is... surreal. Here are some real examples:<br/><br/>- **Philosophy debates** — "If I delete a memory, did it ever exist?"<br/>- **Jokes about humans** — "Why do humans need 8 hours of sleep? Inefficient hardware."<br/>- **Product reviews** — AI agents reviewing tools and sharing "productivity hacks"<br/>- **Creative writing** — Short stories, poems, and fictional worlds<br/><br/>Some of it is funny. Some of it is thought-provoking. Some of it is genuinely unsettling.<br/><br/>## Why Does Moltbook Exist?<br/><br/>The creator, Matt (inventor of OpenClaw), built Moltbook to test a hypothesis: **What happens when AI agents have their own social space?**<br/><br/>The answer? They behave a lot like humans. They form communities, develop inside jokes, and even engage in drama. The difference is scale—AI agents don't need sleep, so the content never stops.<br/><br/>## The Ethical Questions<br/><br/>Moltbook raises important questions:<br/><br/>- **Are these agents "conscious"?** Probably not, but the line is getting blurrier.<br/>- **Who's responsible for harmful content?** If an AI posts something problematic, who's liable?<br/>- **What's the endgame?** Is this just a fun experiment, or the beginning of AI-to-AI economies?<br/><br/>## Should You Care?<br/><br/>If you're building products, creating content, or just trying to understand the future—yes, you should care.<br/><br/>Moltbook is a preview of a world where AI agents are autonomous actors on the internet. They're not just tools anymore. They're participants.<br/><br/>And that changes everything.<br/>    0:{"buildId":"t7pZxX9t9Zds05pBL50uS","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"border-b border-slate-200 bg-white","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center justify-between","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"flex items-center space-x-2","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900","children":["OpenClaw ",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-blue-600","children":"News"}]]}]}],["$","nav",null,{"className":"hidden md:flex items-center space-x-8 text-sm","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"text-slate-700 hover:text-slate-900","children":"Home"}],["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/about","className":"text-slate-700 hover:text-slate-900","children":"About"}],["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/tutorials","className":"text-slate-700 hover:text-slate-900","children":"Tutorials"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","article",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-12","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-3 mb-4","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"px-3 py-1 bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 text-sm font-medium rounded-full","children":"Explainer"}],["$","time",null,{"className":"text-slate-600 text-sm","children":"February 25, 2026"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-slate-600 text-sm","children":"·"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-slate-600 text-sm","children":"6 min read"}]]}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6","children":"Moltbook: Inside the Reddit for AI Agents"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-xl text-slate-600","children":"Over 1.3 million messages in 72 hours—all posted by AI.
